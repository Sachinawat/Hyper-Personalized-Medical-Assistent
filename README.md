# Hyper-Personalized-Medical-Assistent

ü©∫ Dr. MedAI - Hyper-Personalized AI Health Assistant
Dr. MedAI is an interactive, conversational AI health assistant built with Python and Streamlit. It leverages a powerful Large Language Model (via OpenRouter) to simulate an experienced physician, providing personalized guidance based on a user's profile and conversation history.
A key feature of this application is its focus on privacy and local storage. All user profiles and conversation histories are stored as JSON files directly on your machine in the conversations/ directory, ensuring your data remains private.
‚ú® Core Features
Conversational AI: Powered by a detailed system prompt that gives the AI the persona of an experienced, empathetic doctor.
Persistent Chat History: Manages multiple, separate chat sessions, much like modern chat applications (e.g., ChatGPT).
Local-First Storage: All conversation data is stored locally, ensuring user privacy. No data is sent to an external database.
Step-by-Step User Onboarding: For first-time users, the AI initiates a natural, one-question-at-a-time dialogue to build a medical profile.
Secure API Key Management: Uses a .env file to safely manage your API key, keeping it out of the source code.
Intuitive UI: A clean and responsive user interface built with Streamlit, featuring a sidebar for chat management.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Python 3.10+
Streamlit: For the interactive web UI.
OpenAI Python Library: As the client to connect to the OpenRouter API.
OpenRouter API: To access various Large Language Models.
Python-Dotenv: For managing environment variables.

üöÄ Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the Dr. MedAI application running on your local machine.
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine (or simply ensure all the files listed above are in a single project folder).
code
Bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd dr_medai_app
2. Create a Python Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
On Windows:
code
Bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS / Linux:
code
Bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file.
code
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Create the .env File
This is a critical step for storing your API key securely.
Create a new file named .env in the root of the project directory.
Copy and paste the following content into the file:
code
Env
# .env

# Replace the placeholder with your actual OpenRouter API key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# You can change the model here. gpt-3.5-turbo is a good default.
MODEL_NAME="openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"
Important: Replace sk-or-v1-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your real API key from OpenRouter.ai.
‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application
Once you have completed the setup, you can run the application with a single command:
code
Bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the application running. If not, the terminal will provide a local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) that you can navigate to.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
streamlit_app.py: This file renders the entire user interface. It manages the session state, displays the chat history from the active session, and captures user input.
logic.py: This is the application's backend. It handles all file operations (listing, loading, saving, and deleting conversations in the /conversations directory) and makes the API calls to OpenRouter.
prompt.py: This file contains the master prompt that defines Dr. MedAI's personality, rules, safety protocols, and conversational flow. This is the "brain" of the AI.
